# POC for api linting

This will not work yet,
there are issues with

@stoplight/spectal
and
@stoplight/ordered-object-literal 

that need to be addressed.  I will soon fork those in order to apply the fix that works but I am unsure if it is any good.

You probably don't want something like this anyway, what you want is stoplight.io.  this is just for insigating some discussions and fiddling around with.
